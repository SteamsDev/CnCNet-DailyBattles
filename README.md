# CnCNet-DailyBattles
CnCNet/DailyBattles is an unoffocial extension to the CnCNet5 Client made by Rampastring. Its purpose is to emulate a system where a player can play one unique battle per day on their favorite CnC game. It current only supports DTA, but others will be supported in the near future.

This project is currently in a very early stage of development. Any commitments that can be made to the project is greatly appreciated.

Currently a console app made in C#.
