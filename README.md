# CnCNet-DailyBattles
The DailyBattles expansion for the CnCNet Client is a client in itself that allows the user to set up a one-per-day battle system for Skirmish mode. Currently a console application.

This project is currently in a very early stage of development. Any commitments that can be made to the project is greatly appreciated.

Currently a console app made in C#.
